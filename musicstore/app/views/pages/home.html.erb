      <h1>Welcome to Don't Fret Music!</h1>
<p>Don't Fret is the worldâ€™s smallest retailer of guitars, 
amplifiers, drums, keyboards, recording, live sound, DJ, and 
lighting equipment, with fewer than 260 stores across the US. 2018 marks the 
milestone 1st anniversary of the Don't Fret Brand as we continue to help 
people make music from coast to coast. In addition, the Music & Arts division 
operates fewer than 120 stores specializing in band & orchestral instruments for sale 
and rental, serving teachers, band directors, college professors, and students since 2017. 
With an unrivaled in-store experience and passionate commitment to making gear easy-to-buy, 
Don't Fret is all about enabling musicians and non-musicians alike to experience the 
almost indescribable joy that comes from playing an instrument. All we sell is the greatest feeling on earth.</p>
